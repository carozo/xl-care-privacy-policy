    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 15/05/2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how
      <strong>XLCare</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") handles user information.
      This Policy applies solely to the <strong>XLCare</strong> mobile and/or
      desktop application (the “App”).
    </p>

    <p>
      By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or share</strong> any personal
      information or user data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App operates entirely on the user’s local device and does not connect
      to external servers or services. All interactions, including
      health-related queries, are processed locally via an on-device large
      language model (LLM). At no point is any data sent to or received from a
      remote server.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Local Processing Only</h2>
    <p>
      All data processing occurs exclusively on the user’s device. The App does
      not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Require or request an internet connection; with the exception of downloading the model(s)</li>
      <li>Use any external APIs for inference or storage;</li>
      <li>
        Store any personal data after the session ends (unless such storage is
        explicitly handled by the user or the device operating system).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>As the App processes data locally, users are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Securing their device against unauthorized access;</li>
      <li>
        Managing any information stored by the device’s operating system, such
        as app data or logs (if applicable);
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring that the use of the App complies with applicable local laws and
        regulations, including those governing the handling of sensitive
        personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. No Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended solely for informational purposes and does not
      constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users
      should consult a licensed healthcare professional for any medical
      concerns. Use of the App does not create a doctor-patient relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time.
      Updates will be reflected by a change in the “Last Updated” date at the
      top of this document. Continued use of the App following any modifications
      constitutes acceptance of those changes.
    </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>XLCare</strong> does not collect or store any personal data on our servers, as all processing is performed locally on the user's device. Therefore, we do not retain any user data, nor do we have the ability to delete it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any information temporarily processed or stored by the device (e.g., cached data, app state, or logs) is managed by the device's operating system. Users may delete such data at any time by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clearing the App’s cache or data through their device settings;</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the App, which removes all associated locally stored data;</li>
      <li>Managing backups or files stored manually by the user, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
